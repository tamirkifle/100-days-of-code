                <h2>Some of his Accomplishments</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        He has won more Grand Slam singles titles than any other
                        male player. He has 20 men's Grand Slam singles titles.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Federer has been ranked world No. 1 for longer than any
                        other player in the Open Era. Federer has held the No. 1
                        ranking for 310 total weeks and is the only male player
                        in the Open Era to register 300 or more weeks as world
                        No. 1.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Federer is the only player in tennis history who has won
                        6+ titles in 7 different tournaments.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        From February 2004 – August 2008, he spent a staggering
                        237 weeks at the top of the ATP Rankings.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        At the Beijing Olympics in 2008, he teamed up with his
                        friend Stanislas Wawrinka for the Beijing Olympics and
                        won the gold in men’s doubles. He then returned to the
                        Olympics in 2012, where he bagged the Silver in singles.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Federer became the first man in tennis history to win
                        three Slams in the calendar year thrice in his career in
                        2004, 2006, 2007 (Australian Open, Wimbledon
                        Championships, and the US Open). This was a huge
                        achievement and nobody is close to matching it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Wimbledon Domination: He has 8 Wimbledon titles to his
                        name.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        He is also the second player to breach the 100 career
                        titles bracket.
