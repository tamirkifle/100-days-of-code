## Plan
- [Full Screen Responsive Image Slider](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWWNrANNO1k): 🍒
- [100 Days CSS Challenge](https://100dayscss.com/): 🍒

## Distractions
- Procrastination

## Notes
- Learned that transitions work when we add a class or remove a class. You can apply a transition when that specific class gets added.
- [ ] Saw that whenever I solve issues or get a problem done, I feel good, and until then I feel tense and not happy. I want to fix that and feel like all progress is good, take it slow and concentrate more on the progress and the process rather than the destination.

### Progress
