# Day 0

## Plan

-   [HTML CSS Project from Travesty Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsEnj-1hG2o) from scratch: 🍒🍒

## Distractions

-   Family asked me for a divider, had to pause the timer to help them.
-   After the 10min break, I was just at the computer distracting myself with some email so I extended a little bit.

## Notes

-   https://www.cssmatic.com/box-shadow for box shadow and other animations and previews.
-   Breaks should be without any 'stimulants' especially tech-related.
-   flex-basis is specifically flex items but width can usually be overwritten elsewhere due to specificity, so use flex-basis for flex items.
-   CSS: found out about 'object-fit: cover' on img elements. I used it to fill an image on an area without stretching it.
