### Progress

-   My Course Catalog: 🍒
    -   Make it more resuable by removing functions within functions that can be applied elsewhere.
    -   Make cancelEditing overlay only on the course spans and not the course element.
    -   Added a common popUp event listener function and other pop up functions now take the ID No as a parameter.
