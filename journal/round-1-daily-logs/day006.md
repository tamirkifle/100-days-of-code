## Notes

-   learned how to use the html5 video tag.
-   Going one by one coding each section of a website helps keep an untangled mind as well us improves understanding of how the CSS works. Or maybe it was because the project was small.
-   had my first experience doing mobile-first media queries. It was very positive.
