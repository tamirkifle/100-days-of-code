## Plan

-   FEM Static Job Listing Challenge: 🍒

## Distractions

-   A little low energy early, but got on track

## Notes

-   [ ] ...

-   Found out that you can use class selectors with pseudo-class selectors like :last-child and :nth-child, it still uses and counts the tags not the classed elements, but applies the styles only if the selected tags have that class.
