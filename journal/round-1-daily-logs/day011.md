# Day 11

## Plan
- [Responsive Restaurant Website](https://courses.wesbos.com/account/access/5ebd7c8a9edbdf3638123dfa/view/249566909): 🍒🍒

## Distractions
- Naps throughout the day, didn't sleep well last night, procrastination.

## Notes
- [ ] Need to refactor the long term plans for this 100DaysChallenge, feeling like it's getting too repetitive.
- Need to find better ways to approach problems, I just jump in and start coding and I feel like that has diminishing returns.
