## Notes

-   [ ] Had some exercise with CSS grid, need to get clear on how css grid lays elements out.
-   Got clear on the box-sizing property.
-   Got very clear on passing array, and how the variable names are array pointers.
-   I realized when you are trying to solve a complex problem, sometimes your mind gets super tense trying to make everything makes sense, and when it become too much, much like a computer you get stuck and functioning really slowly, and I felt it was even hard to just let go of that train of though, it's like it's tangled up. I found taking a couple of minutes trying to get your mind to get off that thinking train helps, and after you're restarted, the problem seems much mangaeable.

    -   [ ] Got it working with minimal problems, need to make it flow as I want it one element after another from left to right and then row by row.
