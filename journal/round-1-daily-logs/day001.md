## Distractions
- Dreading starting, doing other stuff


## Notes
- There is a border type line between my img and my h2 tag... have to figure it out.
- Found out that collapsing margins still occur if the margin one of the elements is zero. Fixed with overflow: auto;
- Got stuck because a font I was loading from a github link wouldn't load, found out that the server wasn't sending the right headers.
