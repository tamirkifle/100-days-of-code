## Distractions
- Dreading starting, doing other stuff


## Notes
- There is a border type line between my img and my h2 tag... have to figure it out.
- Found out that collapsing margins still occur if the margin one of the elements is zero. Fixed with overflow: auto;
- Got stuck because a font I was loading from a github link wouldn't load, found out that the server wasn't sending the right headers.
- Found out how hard media queries can be when targetting a lot of screen sizes and how responsive design is not as easy as it seems.
- Hard to get timining right since after the timer goes of for rest session, I continue working some more just to finish the problem I was on.
- Need to read on why mobile-first media queries.
