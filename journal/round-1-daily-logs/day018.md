## Notes
- Found out svgs can be added as the source of img tags, easy!
- The mobile version is where I started, trying to get it perfectly equal to the design image, but as soon as I resized it a bit, it was not good anymore. SO designing responsively is very important.
  
### Progress
- Did the mobile screen size, started the Desktop version, layout is complete, needs a bit of cleaning up and adjusting for more screen sizes.
