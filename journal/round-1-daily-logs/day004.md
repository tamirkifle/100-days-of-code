## Distractions

-   Not much today :D

## Notes

-   [ ] Shall I use flexbox to center my content or is there a less hacky way?
-   Learned a lot about accessibility:
    -   Understood that the article tag is for wrapping independent self-contained content. I might have been using it wrong.
    -   Also understood that h1 through h6 are also important for accessibility, and a page should contain only one h1 tag which is the main header.
    -   Understood how to use the label element properly.
-   learned how "display:flex" makes the flex items positioned for the z-index to work.
-   putting a background in the :before so that you can control them (eg.their opacity) separately.
-   learned how to use "background-attachment:fixed" to create a parallax effect.
-   had some practice with CSS animations.
