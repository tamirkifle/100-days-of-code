## Notes

-   [ ] ...
-   Learned a lot about accessibility:
    -   Understood that the article tag is for wrapping independent self-contained content. I might have been using it wrong.
    -   Also understood that h1 through h6 are also important for accessibility, and a page should contain only one h1 tag which is the main header.
    -   Understood how to use the label element properly.
