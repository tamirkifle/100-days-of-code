## Distractions

-   Feeling tired, want a nap
-   Reminiscing with old NES games, took a 30min nap... 
-   adding VS Code themes
-   Fixing my monitor for eye-strain, then in aliexpress looking for a wireless keyboard.
-   Banana cake tasting.

## Notes

-  Worked with the DOM from Javascript... need more experience with this.
- Had a tough grid image gallery project which took me the whole of today.
- The importance of thinking through logic carefully before coding and figuring it out along the way is immense... will save you a lot of time.
