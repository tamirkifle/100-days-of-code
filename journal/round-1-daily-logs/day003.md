## Distractions

-   Tiredness, pushing work to later
-   When it gets late, house is crowded, tv is loud, a lot of interactions.

## Notes

-   [ ] height: 100% doesn't work?
-   [ ] how to put the copyright at the end of the page at whatever screen size:
    -   pulled it off with absolute positioning and aligning with left right and bottom properties. Is it the best way?
-   Revised CSS animations on fCC, got clear on how the cubic-bezier animation-timing-function works... really took my time with it.
-   Used a lot of viewport measurements for responsive design, helped a lot... need practice with this.
-   margin: auto doesn't work for vertical alignment since the containers can grow as content increases.

### Progress

-   [Pluralsight Login Page Clone - HTML & CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIx1O5Y5EB4): 🍒🍒
