## Day 0

Project :- 

[HTML CSS Project from Travesty Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsEnj-1hG2o): üçíüçí

Progress :-
- Finished the structure of the page, HTML 
- Finished doing the styling for first section: the page landing.

Notes :-
- https://www.cssmatic.com/box-shadow for box shadow and other animations and previews.
- flex-basis is specifically flex items but width can usually be overwritten elsewhere due to specificity, so use flex-basis for flex items.
- CSS: found out about  'object-fit: cover' on img elements. I used it to fill an image on an area without stretching it.

Tasks for tomorrow :-
- Finish building [HTML CSS Project from Travesty Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsEnj-1hG2o): üçíüçí

## Day 1

Project :- 

[HTML CSS Project from Travesty Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsEnj-1hG2o): üçíüçí

Progress :-

- Finished the webpage with the media queries.

Notes :-

- [ ] There is a border type line between my img and my h2 tag... have to figure it out.
- [ ] Need to read on why mobile-first media queries.
- Found out that collapsing margins still occur if the margin one of the elements is zero. Fixed with overflow: auto;
- Got stuck because a font I was loading from a github link wouldn't load, found out that the server wasn't sending the right headers.
- Found out how hard media queries can be when targetting a lot of screen sizes and how responsive design is not as easy as it seems.
- Hard to get time tracking right since after the timer goes off for rest session, I continue working some more just to finish the problem I was on.
