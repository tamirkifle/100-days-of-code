## Day 0

Project :-

-   [HTML CSS Project from Travesty Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsEnj-1hG2o): üçíüçí

Progress :-

-   Finished the structure of the page, HTML
-   Finished doing the styling for first section: the page landing.

Notes :-

-   https://www.cssmatic.com/box-shadow for box shadow and other animations and previews.
-   flex-basis is specifically flex items but width can usually be overwritten elsewhere due to specificity, so use flex-basis for flex items.
-   CSS: found out about 'object-fit: cover' on img elements. I used it to fill an image on an area without stretching it.

Progress :-

Notes :-

-   [ ] There is a border type line between my img and my h2 tag... have to figure it out.
-   [ ] Need to read on why mobile-first media queries.
-   Found out that collapsing margins still occur if the margin one of the elements is zero. Fixed with overflow: auto;
-   Got stuck because a font I was loading from a github link wouldn't load, found out that the server wasn't sending the right headers.
-   Found out how hard media queries can be when targetting a lot of screen sizes and how responsive design is not as easy as it seems.
-   Hard to get time tracking right since after the timer goes off for rest session, I continue working some more just to finish the problem I was on.

Project :-

-   [Pluralsight Login Page Clone - HTML & CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIx1O5Y5EB4): üçíüçí

Progress :-

-   Finished working on the page, with the media queries, totally responsive.

Notes :-

-   [ ] height: 100% doesn't work?
-   [ ] how to put the copyright at the end of the page at whatever screen size:
    -   pulled it off with absolute positioning and aligning with left right and bottom properties. Is it the best way?
-   Revised CSS animations on fCC, got clear on how the cubic-bezier animation-timing-function works... really took my time with it.
-   Used a lot of viewport measurements for responsive design, helped a lot... need practice with this.
-   margin: auto doesn't work for vertical alignment since the containers can grow as content increases.

    -   Understood how to use the label element properly.
-   learned how "display:flex" makes the flex items positioned for the z-index to work.

-   had some practice with CSS animations.
