## Day 0

Project :- 

[HTML CSS Project from Travesty Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsEnj-1hG2o): üçíüçí

Progress :-
- Finished the structure of the page, HTML 
- Finished doing the styling for first section: the page landing.

Notes :-
- https://www.cssmatic.com/box-shadow for box shadow and other animations and previews.
- flex-basis is specifically flex items but width can usually be overwritten elsewhere due to specificity, so use flex-basis for flex items.
- CSS: found out about  'object-fit: cover' on img elements. I used it to fill an image on an area without stretching it.

Tasks for tomorrow :-
